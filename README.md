# picExtractor
Extracts pictures from .doc and .docx files

Uses python to extract picture files from word documents. Pictures will be extracted into the directory in which the script is run. They will be named simply "Picture - ###" for differentiation.

Issues:

Currently configured for a Linux file structure, will need to be modified to work on Windows. Use \\\\ to get a single \ litteral in your strings.

Might not get all the pictures? I had some issues pulling 100% of the pictures when testing (only happens sometime). Give me feedback, if something wonky (technical term) happens.
